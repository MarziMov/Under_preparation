Computational Analysis of Protein Corona Formation in Biological Protein-Nanoparticle Interaction

Nanoparticles (NPs) are being increasingly considered in the biomedical applications
such as bioimaging, biosensing, nanomedicine, nanotoxicology, drug delivery and 
hyperthermic therapies. When NPs enter a biological milieu, biomolecules particularly
proteins (in form of lipoproteins) start to adsorb on to the surface of NPs. 
The formation of protein layers on the surface of NPs is referred to as - protein corona. 
In fact, cells often interact with the NPs with the modified surface and therefore 
the subsequent cellular/tissue responses depend on the composition of the protein corona. 
For instance, protein corona formation accelerates the pulmonary clearance of NPs in the body. 
In essence, cellular responses to NPs with corona are significantly different than that of the NP itself.
In this study SSA, Dxrd , œÅ, D h , PdI, Zeta and hydrophobicity are analyzed to show 
how they affect the protein corona composition which is highly beneficial to predict and study 
the protein corona composition and dynamics.  

In this study we analyze the effect of aforementioned nanoparticle features using 
polynomial, Ridge, LASSO and Elastic Net regressions. Since, Ridge and LASSO are better at variable selection 
and due to regularization they perform better for the predictive performance. In addition, they are able to use 
correlated variables appropriately.
